## Features — Planned

- **Render sample journal** — planned module; not implemented.
- **Scene resource worksheet** — planned module; not implemented.
- **Device comparison notes** — planned module; not implemented.

The proposed workflow separates render sample journal from scene resource worksheet, with device comparison notes retained for reproducibility. These are design goals, not claims about existing functionality.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- A Markdown viewer or text editor.
- Your own test data and a separate copy if experiments are planned.
- Reading this specification does not require Node.js, Python, package installation, or account credentials.

### Review the documentation

1. Record the exact product version and input provenance.
2. Prepare a separate test copy, not your only original.
3. Describe one baseline scenario for **Render sample journal**.
4. Review the acceptance criteria in [VERIFICATION.md](./VERIFICATION.md).
5. Do not treat this specification as proof of a working tool.

There are no application startup commands: an executable implementation has not been created.

## Security & Tools Configuration

Observe and report first; any later change requires separate confirmation. Do not disable antivirus, updates, or other protections. No automatic data deletion or guaranteed performance gains. Do not collect passwords, tokens, or private file contents.

Proposed design requirements: local processing, explicit file selection, separate outputs, and no default telemetry. These are requirements for a future implementation, not tested properties. Verify restoration on a copy before any state-changing operation.

## Usage Guide

### Render sample journal

Define the input and expected outcome for module 1. Record the Blender version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### Scene resource worksheet

Define the input and expected outcome for module 2. Record the Blender version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### Device comparison notes

Define the input and expected outcome for module 3. Record the Blender version, scenario conditions, and known limitations. Completing these notes manually does not establish that an automated tool exists.

### At a glance

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Target | Blender |
| Category | Application workflow specification |
| Input | Manual notes or user-authorized local exports |
| Planned output | Render sample journal |
| Compatibility | Unverified; no supported version claimed |
| Current release | None |

### After an update

- [ ] Record the new version and input format changes.
- [ ] Repeat the baseline scenario on a copy.
- [ ] Mark old compatibility assumptions as unverified.
- [ ] Retain the previous report separately.

Metadata uses the Repos_2 sample fields: Repository_name, Description, licence, and tags. The licence field is empty as in the sample; MIT text is supplied in LICENSE and license.md. RELEASE_SETTINGS and a RELEASE folder are omitted because no release exists.
